Method: Linear Regression
Result: Reject H0 (p < 0.05)
Conclusion: Significant relationship exists

# Test 2: Reviewer Followers vs Rating
H0: Reviewer followers don't affect rating (Œ≤1 = 0)  
H1: More followers lead to higher ratings (Œ≤1 > 0)
Method: Linear Regression
Result: Reject H0 (p < 0.05)

# Test 3: Cuisine Variety vs Rating
H0: Cuisine variety doesn't affect rating (Œ≤3 = 0)
H1: More variety leads to higher ratings (Œ≤3 > 0)
Method: Chi-squared Test
Result: Reject H0 (p < 0.05)

üì± Sample Code Snippets
Restaurant Analysis
python
# Find restaurants sharing same price point
def analyze_price_distribution(df):
    price_groups = df.groupby('Cost')['Name'].apply(list).reset_index()
    price_groups['Count'] = price_groups['Name'].apply(len)
    return price_groups.sort_values('Count', ascending=False)

# Result: 13 restaurants at ‚Çπ500 price point
Review Sentiment Analysis
python
# Extract top reviewers by influence
def get_top_reviewers(df, n=5):

        'Reviewer_Total_Review': 'max',
        'Reviewer_Followers': 'max', 
        'Rating': 'mean'
    }).sort_values('Reviewer_Followers', ascending=False).head(n)

    pca = PCA(n_components=0.95)  # 95% variance retention
    features_pca = pca.fit_transform(features_scaled)
    
    # K-Means clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
